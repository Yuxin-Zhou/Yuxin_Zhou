## Self-Introduction

I'm now an undergraduate student,who has strong interest in mathematics. Consequently, I wish to pursue graduate studies in mathematics,especially computational mathematics.


## Education Background

      * 2014.9-Now     East China Normal University       
          mathematics and applied mathematics   GPA:3.86
     ＜/br＞
      * 2017.1-2017.5  University of California-Berkeley
          concurrent enrollment                 GPA:4.00

## Research Experience
    
   * 2017.5-2017.8  University of Alberta    Research Assistant
   
     Project: Ocean Data Analysis from Numerical Simulation Models
  * Overview: Developing computational scripts written in Matlab to work with the output from the eddy-permitting numerical oceal models to analyze and visualize the key processes and their variability.

    * plot the mean temperature and salinity on some specific sections
    * estimate the volume and fresh water transport across each section as a timeseries
 and the determine the long term average.
