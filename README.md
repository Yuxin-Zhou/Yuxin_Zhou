## Self-Introduction

I'm now an undergraduate student,who has strong interest in mathematics. Consequently, I wish to pursue graduate studies in mathematics,especially computational mathematics.


## Education Background
- 2014.9-Now     East China Normal University,  mathematics and applied mathematics       
  - **GPA:3.86**
- 2017.1- 2017.5    University of California-Berkeley
 , concurrent enrollment                     
  - **GPA:4.00**

## Research Experience
- 2017.5-2017.8  University of Alberta,     Research Assistant
  - Project: Ocean Data Analysis from Numerical Simulation Models
      - Overview: Developing computational scripts written in Matlab to work with the output from the eddy-permitting numerical ocean models to analyze and visualize the key processes and their variability.

        - plot the mean annual 2014-2016 temperature and salinity on some specific sections;and also velocity perpendicular to the section, which the data comes from the eddy-permitting numerical ocean models in different resolutions.
        - estimate the volume and fresh water transport across each section as a timeseries with both 5 day variability and monthly running mean and then determine the long term average.

## Computational skills
- Algorithm: Matlab, C++, Phython
- Operating System: Windows, Linux
